## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- Vanilla Javascript
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/) - Leaflet library
- [IP Geolocation](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - IP Geolocation API docs

### What I learned

I learned how to properly read web API docs with this project. I was able to use and manipulate the Leaflet maps and how to integrate google maps tile in it. I further understood how to work with JSON files. I also learned about the DOMContentLoaded event.

### Continued development

I am overall super satisfied with how this project turned out in the end. I think this would be a good project for me to practice a Javascript framework in the future. 

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet Icon Guide](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#icon) - This is a very comprehensive guide for manipualting icons in leaflet.
- [IPvoid](https://www.ipvoid.com/random-ip/) - Great resource for generating random IP codes for testing purposes.
- [Leaflet Map API with Google Satellite layer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9394190/leaflet-map-api-with-google-satellite-layer) - This forum page made me understood how to apply Google Map tiles in my map section with Leaflet.
- [Refresh Leaflet map](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19186428/refresh-leaflet-map-map-container-is-already-initialized) - This helped me fix a bug in how to remove, add, and change the map view in leaflet.
- [Relocate Leaflet zoom control](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33614912/how-to-locate-leaflet-zoom-control-in-a-desired-position) - very useful answer in hwo to relocate leaflet's built in zoom control.
